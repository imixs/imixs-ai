 @AppTester I whant to design a new purchase process for my company

 @AppTester Yes, we need a purchase process for our production line to order material. Depending on the kind of the material and the costs
 the process need to be approved by the management. At the end of the process the creator gets an e-mail notification that 
 he is allowed to order the material.
